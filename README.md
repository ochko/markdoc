# Markdoc

A markdown to html converter with sequence diagram and flowchart support. Generating documents including diagrams has advantages:

- Docs can be checked into version control like source code, and can compare changes effectively as it is all text
- Making and updating diagrams using drawing software is slow

It converts markdown codeblocks for diagrams using [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org). Pseudocode to Graphviz is inspired by this [gist](https://gist.github.com/antimatter15/1841460). Pseudocode is converted to dot file and then Graphviz's `dot` program converts it to vector image.

## System requirements

- Ruby 2.7.6 and up
- Graphviz (tested with dot version 3.0.0)

#### OS X

`$ brew install graphviz`

#### Linux (debian, ubuntu)

`$ apt-get install graphviz`

#### Linux (fedora, rhel or centos)

`$ yum install graphviz`


## Installing

`$ gem install markdoc`

For bundler add `gem markdoc` to your Gemfile.


## Usage

`$ markdoc document.md > document.html`

Generated html includes inline svg diagrams, eliminating need for attached image files. It provides 3 executables:
- `markdoc` converts markdown document to html
- `pseudo2svg` converts pseudocode to svg image (see below for pseudocode format)
- `sequence2svg` converts sequence diagram spec to svg image(see below for sequence diagram spec format)

### Pseudocode blocks

Currently it supports only `if/else` branch logic, but you can achieve a lot with it.

```
if ConditionN
  Action-A
  Action-B
else
  Action-C
end
```

Include codeblock with `pseudo` language in your markdown.

<pre>
```pseudo
visit registration page
enter email address
if new user
  fill in registration form
  submit
  if validation error
    fix registration form
    review the fix
    submit
  else
    submit
  end
else
  enter password
  if password wrong
    ask password again
  else
    good to go
  end
  confirm account info
end
confirm registration info
```
</pre>

Or you could compile individual pseudocode to vector image. Below is generated by:

`$ pseudo2svg examples/example.pseudo > examples/flowchart.svg`

### Sequence diagram

Include codeblock with `sequence` language in your markdown. Sequence diagram starts with actor declaration(becomes symbol of man), then object declaration(becomes big rectangles with vertical lifeline), then follows messages. Message format is:
- `A -> B : Label` - Arrow from A to B with Label over it. Arrows work either way, so it is equivalent to `B <- A : Label`
- `A <~ B : Label` - Dashed arrow representing return message. Also works for other direction. so it is same as `B ~> A : Label`
- `C : Label` - Message to C itself. Actually it is same as `C -> C : Label`

<pre>
```sequence
Student = Actor
P = Partner Site
App = Web App
Api = Reg API

Student -> P : Choose course(S)
P -> Api : Issue key for(S)
P <~ Api : Registration key(K)
P -> App : Register with key(K)
Student <~ App : Registration form
Student -> App : Fill the form(F)
App : Save the form(F)
App -> Api : Register(K, F) # New API
Api : Create course
App <~ Api : Course details(C)
App : Save(C)
Student <~ App : Show course summary
Student -> Api : Click study button
Student <~ Api : Show mypage
```
</pre>

Or you could compile individual sequence diagram to vector image. Below is generated by:

`$ sequence2svg examples/example.sequence > examples/sequence.svg`

![sequence](http://ochko.github.io/markdoc/examples/sequence.svg "Sequence")

### Others

When printing docs you might want to break pages at specific line. You can use this markup for that:

```html
<p class="page-break"><!-- break --></p>
```

See [examples/doc.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ochko/markdoc/master/examples/doc.md) for complete example.

## Contributing

Fork the repo, and send a pull request. I promise I will merge almost all PR's as soon as you don't break existing behaviour. ;) More than welcome if you implement other diagram types. Please add a bit of test for your implementation if you add a feature.
